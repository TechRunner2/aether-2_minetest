# Aether 2 for Minetest
This is a recreation of the Aether II mod for minecraft into minetest. All rights to texture assets are reserved to the original creators of the Aether II mod.

  This is an attempt to recreate the aether 2 mod for minetest from being a minecraft mod. I do not have any permission by the original creators of the aether 2 mod to create this. It is only ment to be for my own enjoyment and seeing if I can recreate the mod. I have no intent on makeing any money off this mod nor do I intend on taking credit for thing that I did not make myself.
  
  If any knowledgeable minetest modders would like to help please contact me just note this is all done in spare time and may take a while to be finished.
  
  I am new to minetest modding so development of the mod may be slow especially for more complex blocks and items.
  
  
  Mod Road map: (May be worked on out of order)
    1. Get basic blocks and items in
    2. add crafting recipies.
    3. add tool groups so only aether tools affect aether blocks
    4. add item uses
    5. add armor enhancements
    6. add mobs
    7. work on mob ai
